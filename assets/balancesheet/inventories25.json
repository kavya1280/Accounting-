    { "insight": "Quality Rejected Items Issued to Production", "amount": 2290, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Issuing rejected materials to production leads to incorrect valuation of inventory and production WIP. The value of unusable items remains capitalized, overstating assets." },
    { "insight": "Low Recovery against Standard Norms", "amount": 1280, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Low recovery (i.e., lower yield of finished goods from input materials) results in higher consumption of raw materials per output unit, which may cause overvaluation of WIP or under-recorded finished goods inventory." },
    { "insight": "Supplier Quality Audit Score", "amount": 1405, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Poor supplier audit scores may indicate higher risk of substandard materials entering production, leading to potential inventory write-downs or revaluation. Payments may be withheld or delayed for suppliers failing quality audits until compliance is verified, affecting liability recognition." },

Expired materials could still appear as active, inflating asset values. Inconsistent shelf life treatment may lead to non-compliance with accounting standards (e.g., IAS 2 / Ind AS 2) related to inventory valuation and obsolescence." },
    { "insight": "Deviation in Standard v/s Actual Consumption", "amount": 1205, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Incorrect consumption data affects closing inventory valuation.

    { "insight": "Abnormal movement vs production", "amount": 980, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Abnormal material usage or loss affects closing inventory valuation â€” unaccounted movement may reduce material balances or inflate WIP/FG quantities inaccurately. Abnormal material movement distorts cost records and misrepresents operational efficiency in disclosures." },
    { "insight": "Scrap Sales", "amount": 875, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "Scrap generated during production, when sold, should reduce inventory value and record revenue appropriately. Incorrect posting may overstate/understate sales income or inventory valuation." },
    { "insight": "Actual Yield Loss v/s Standard Yield Loss", "amount": 672, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "A higher actual yield loss compared to the standard yield loss indicates production inefficiency or wastage. This increases production cost and reduces inventory valuation, impacting gross profit. Lower actual loss than standard improves margins." },
    { "insight": "Consumption Booked post Output Generation", "amount": 498, "percentage": 0.23, "description": "When material consumption is booked after output generation, it leads to timing mismatches between production and consumption.
