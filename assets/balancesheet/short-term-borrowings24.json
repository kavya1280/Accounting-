            "description": "Effective Cost Driver Analysis can lead to immediate operational efficiencies and reduced working capital needs, potentially decreasing the need for short-term financing (e.g., overdrafts, commercial paper) to cover day-to-day operations or unexpected shortfalls. Poor analysis, conversely, could increase the need."

If these must be recalled, reworked, or replaced, the sudden, unplanned expenditure on materials, labor, and logistics creates an immediate working capital strain, necessitating short-term borrowings to bridge the gap."
