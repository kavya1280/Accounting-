This can improve the company's long-term financial stability and credit rating, making it easier and cheaper to secure large, long-term loans (e.g., bonds, term loans) for capital projects, expansion, or acquisitions."

            "description": "Risk Identification is the foundational step. Identifying significant long-term risks (e.g., technological obsolescence, political instability) allows a company to plan financially. These risks might necessitate long-term borrowings to fund major counter-measures, such as R&D into new technologies or diversification into new markets"

            "description": "Risk Prioritization focuses resources on the most critical risks. Addressing high-priority, high-impact risks often requires substantial, multi-year investments (e.g., building redundant infrastructure, significant M&A). These major, enduring expenditures are typically financed through long-term debt."

Instead of borrowing, this planning leads to the establishment of Long-Term Provisions or reserves on the balance sheet, ensuring funds are available when needed without having to scramble for high-cost debt later."

If the most efficient long-term scenario involves significant debt for a large capital expenditure, it directly leads to securing Long-Term Borrowings to fund the project."
