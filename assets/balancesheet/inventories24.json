  { "insight": "Defect vs Return Rate", "amount": 2455, "description": "High defect or return rates can lead to increased inventory of returned goods or provisions for returns. Returned goods pending inspection affect inventory valuation, and provisions may be required for expected customer returns." },
  { "insight": "Supplier Defect Rate", "amount": 3218, "description": "Defective supplies identified after goods receipt may lead to blocked stock, inventory revaluation, or pending GR/IR adjustments. Supplier claims can also temporarily affect payables until resolution." },
  { "insight": "Quality Rejected Items Issued to Production", "amount": 2267, "description": "Issuing rejected materials to production leads to incorrect valuation of inventory and production WIP. The value of unusable items remains capitalized, overstating assets." },
  { "insight": "Low Recovery against Standard Norms", "amount": 1267, "description": "Low recovery results in higher consumption of raw materials per output unit, which may cause overvaluation of WIP or under-recorded finished goods inventory." },
  { "insight": "Supplier Quality Audit Score", "amount": 1391, "description": "Poor supplier audit scores may indicate higher risk of substandard materials entering production, leading to potential inventory write-downs or revaluation. Payments may be withheld or delayed for suppliers failing quality audits until compliance is verified, affecting liability recognition." },
  { "insight": "Process Deviation Reports", "amount": 1012, "description": "Deviations in process parameters may result in off-spec or defective batches, requiring revaluation, write-downs, or segregation of inventory." },

  { "insight": "Single Source Vendor", "amount": 825, "description": "Delays or shortages from a single vendor may affect production and inventory levels. Heavy dependence on one supplier can impact payment terms and cash flow stability." },

  { "insight": "Sales Return of Expired/Short Expiry Material", "amount": 2802, "description": "Expired or short-expiry goods may be unsellable, leading to inventory write-downs or provisions. Credit notes or return adjustments reduce receivables; delays in recording can cause temporary AR overstatement." },
  { "insight": "Excess Delivery to Customer", "amount": 2199, "description": "Excess goods issued reduce inventory; if billed, increases receivables; if unbilled, may create delivery-based liability." },

  { "insight": "Sale of Expired Stocks", "amount": 2368, "description": "Selling expired stock indicates poor inventory control and may require inventory write-downs or adjustments to reduce overstated asset values." },
  { "insight": "Multiple Shelf Life for Some Material/Batch", "amount": 3267, "description": "Having multiple shelf lives for the same batch may result in incorrect valuation or recognition of obsolete inventory. Expired materials could still appear as active, inflating asset values." },
  { "insight": "Deviation in Standard v/s Actual Consumption", "amount": 1193, "description": "Incorrect consumption data affects closing inventory valuation. Overstated consumption reduces inventory value, while understated consumption inflates it." },
  { "insight": "Abnormal movement vs production", "amount": 970, "description": "Abnormal material usage or loss affects closing inventory valuation â€” unaccounted movement may reduce material balances or inflate WIP/FG quantities inaccurately." },
  { "insight": "Scrap Sales", "amount": 866, "description": "Scrap generated during production, when sold, should reduce inventory value and record revenue appropriately. Incorrect posting may overstate/understate sales income or inventory valuation." },
  { "insight": "Actual Yield Loss v/s Standard Yield Loss", "amount": 665, "description": "A higher actual yield loss compared to the standard yield loss indicates production inefficiency or wastage. This increases production cost and reduces inventory valuation, impacting gross profit." },
  { "insight": "Consumption Booked post Output Generation", "amount": 493, "description": "When material consumption is booked after output generation, it leads to timing mismatches between production and consumption." },
  { "insight": "Expired Material Issued to production order", "amount": 318, "description": "When expired materials are issued, the inventory balance is reduced incorrectly (since the material has no realizable value), leading to potential overstatement of WIP or finished goods." },
  { "insight": "Anomalies from Physical Verification of Inventory", "amount": 128, "description": "Physical count discrepancies (shortage or excess) cause overstatement or understatement of inventory on the balance sheet." },

  { "insight": "Sales Return of Expired/Short Expiry Goods", "amount": 3443, "description": "Returned goods (expired or short expiry) increase inventory temporarily if restocked or are written off. Accounts Receivable decreases as the sales return is recognized." },
